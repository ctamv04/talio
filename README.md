## Description of project

Welcome to Group 27's Talio application, developed as part of the CSE1105 Course at TU Delft.

Talio is an advanced task management application built with Java, REST and JavaFX.

Run any amount of Server instances on a local network, each supporting one Workspace and connection for an arbitrary amount of different Clients. 

Manage your daily, academic, or professional tasks efficiently by using TaskCards, which are highly customizable and provide support for Subtasks and Tags that allow for better management of your tasks. Organize your TaskCards in highly customizable TaskLists and Boards to maximize your working speed and efficiency.

Alternatively, you kay use any of the Clients in temporary Admin mode. This way, you can view and manage all Boards currently saved on a Server.
