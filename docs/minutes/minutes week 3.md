### 1. Important data

**Location:** DW PC1 cubicle 6
**Date:** 28th of February 2023
**Time:** 14.45-15.30
**Attendees:** Janusz Urbanski, Christos Tamvakas, Ksenia Sycheva, Eduard Mihai, Ilse Inanc, Yasir al-Hasnawy, Carina-Silvia Oprean

### 2. Backlog discussion and corrections

+ Deal with the acceptance criteria. (!)
+ Improve the Epics. Currently using MOSCOW
+ Feedback from TA
    + Due to miscommunication. MOSCOW is no longer allowed, Epics are required. A mistake from the TA.
    + The order was good and the structure was good.
    + Instead of MOSCOW, categorize in Epics
        + See Lecture Slides
    + Structure is well, just change to Epics.
    + The draft doesn't account to the grade
    + Instead of Must -> Basic Requirements
    + Take out complex features, and make an epic for those. 
    + Multi Board could be an Epic for example.
    + Just recategorize the requirements into Epics.
    + Acceptance criteria are for more complex user stories.
    + The project is not only graded against the Backlog provided, but against a mixture of our own and the one provided.
    + For a Perfect grade, ALL features should be implemented.
    + If we miss a basic feature we fail the project.
+ We should add Mock Ups to the final Backlog
+ Add non-functional system requirements to Backlog
    + Don't worry too much about them, not required.
    + System requirements can be functional and non-functional.
+ Problems with Java 19 according to Mattermost
    + Perhaps stick to Java 17?
    + Java 17 is the long term supported version

### 3. Checkstyle

+ 2 Presets, Google style, Sun Microsystems (Presets in IntelliJ).
    + Perhaps use one of those? *No! That is not allowed*
        + Standardized.
        + Will useit in the future.
        + Saves a lot of time and headaches.
        + Look at them and perhaps adjust them.
+ Agree on 10+ Checkstyle rules. 
+ Feedback from TA
    + The standardized ones already have basically everything. So can't really be improved.  
    + Checkstyle rules are flexible. Don't delete rules, but can always add rules.
    + We should use our own Checkstyle rules.
+ Look at the standardized to see how it's done professionally.
+ Everyone uses IntelliJ


### 4. Question / Feedback round

+ Git Assignment
    + Just complete the assignment on the site.
    + Use your personal GitLab
