# Meeting


#### Meeting Organization

Chair of week 6: Christos   
Minute taker of week 6: Eduard  
Minute taker of previous week (the one to whom the feedback is addressed): Janusz

Mark: Pass


#### Agenda

Mark: Good

Feedback: The agenda was added to the repository in time and it followed the template.  
The individual points were clear, but a bit more information regarding the main points can be added in the future (things like specific questions from the other teammembers, important decisions that you need to adress for each main topic and so on).


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Good

Feedback: Notes are clear and contain concrete agreements, decisions and suggestions.      
The agreements are actionable and realistic. A summary of action points at the end would be a nice addition.      
Maybe try to also include a part where you state which tasks are assigned to which people for a better overview of the next steps.

#### Chair performance


Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The chair ensured that all topics from the agenda were covered for an appropiate amount of time.      
The flow of the meeting went well and the timings were good.      
Chair was clearly leading the meeting, making sure the note taker writes down important information and actively involving everyone in the conversation.


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Good

Feedback: The team took ownership of the meeting.       
However, this time not everyone was active in the meeting. There were times when a couple of people were not involved in the discussion.    
The overall atmosphere was constructive. Students were coming up with solutions for the problems and were discussing important topics in depth.


#### Potentially Shippable Product


Mark: Very Good

Feedback: The current state of the application was "potentially shippable".  
There was progress compared to last week: basics features are (almost) done.    
Make sure that you "level up" your contributions so that you all have (aprox) equal contributions.    
Pay attention to the people that didn't work enough so far for the product and try to divide the tasks accordingly.
