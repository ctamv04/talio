# Week 2

## Formative assessment

- **Chair**: Yasir Al-Hasnawy
- **Notetaker**: Ilse Inanc


#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass

#### Agenda

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: The agenda followed the template.  
Good use of time indications. Those can be really useful for structuring the meeting especially in weeks that you have much to talk about.  
I liked the addition with the 'Notes' section at the end.

#### Chair performance

Mark: Good

Feedback: The chair takes into consideration the teammates' opinions and goes in depth through all the topics in the agenda.    
Checks from now and then if the minute taker is writing down important decisions or suggestions from me.    
Most of the points were discussed according to the 'schedule'.

#### Time management

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: All the topics were covered for an appropriate amount of time.  
Try to not get lost in one of the topics, because afterwards everything is delayed.   
For example, it was good that you discussed the general thoughts and ideas about the backlog, but you can solve details like what specifically will be written in it after the meeting or during one of your internal meetings.  
Use the short weekly time you have with the TA!

#### Minute taker performance

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The notes contain the team agreements, important decisions, future deadlines and suggestions from me.  
Everything was written down while talking, together with any modifications.  
The notes document is comprehensive and has a good structure, following the topics discussed based on the agenda.
Notes sent right after the meeting.

#### Relation

Mark: Good

Feedback: The communication throughout the meeting went well. I did not have to intervene too much (only when I was asked for help)  
The chairman tried to involve everyone, including persons that did not speak up before, but still there are some times when a couple of them are silent for a longer time or until they are asked something. Try to improve on this in the future!  
Everyone was listened to and different opinions were taken into account for important decisions.
