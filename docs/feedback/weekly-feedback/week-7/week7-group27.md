The agreements are actionable and realistic. Great TO DO list for the overview of the next steps.


#### Chair performance

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: The topics from the agenda were covered, but it didn't really feel like the meeting was completely led by the chair.


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: Clear improvement from last weeks. Everyone was active and involved in the discussion.  
The team took ownership of the meeting. The overall atmosphere was constructive. Students were coming up with solutions for the problems and were discussing impportant topics in depth.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: Demo had clear improvements from last weeks. You should finish the basic requirements as soon as possible (if they are not done yet).  
After that, try to implement as much as possible from the other epics, while keeping in mind the prioritization of the epics and the task division between team members.
