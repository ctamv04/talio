# Meeting


#### Meeting Organization

Chair of week 4: Ilse Inanc  
Minute taker of week 4: Janusz Urbanski   
Minute taker of previous week (the one to whom the feedback is addressed): Yasir Al-Hasnawy

Mark: Pass


#### Agenda

Mark: Good

Feedback: The agenda was added to the repository on time and it folled the template.  
The individual points were clear, but a bit more information regarding the main points can be added in the future (things like specific questions from the other teammembers, important decisions that you need to adress for each main topic and so on).


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: The notes are clear and contain concrete agreements.  
It also contains future deadlines for tasks along with the assigned people for them.
I like the highlighting of the *when*, *who*. This makes the future actions easy to follow, even if the section is a bit long.  
Be careful with notes that are too long in the future. If they become unclear, then the teammates will tend to get lost in too much information.


#### Chair performance

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: The topics from the agenda were covered, but they were not discussed in depth. You should focus more on each topic, instead of just opening up the topic and only discussing for a couple of minutes.  
Also make sure that you make use of the time indications better. In order to stick to the schedule that you initially had planned, you must ensure that each meeting topic is well discussed and understood by each member before moving onto the next one. You can also come up with more questions about each topic that you can also add to the agenda. 


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Good

Feedback: Everyone was active in the meeting and involved in the discussion.  
The flow of the meeting went well, everyone was coming up with ideas and suggestions.  
The overall atmoshere was constructive and you did also improve a bit from last times when it comes to "everyone talking" during the meeting, but you still have some "weak" points.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: The team did present the current state of the application, but because things were not merged to main yet, there wasn't much to show.  
Regardless, I think that the team will manage to create a working application until the end of the project.
