# Meeting


#### Meeting Organization

Chair of week 3: Janusz Urbanski  
Minute taker of week 3: Yasir Al-Hasnawy  
Minute taker of previous week (the one to whom the feedback is addressed): Ilse Inanc

Mark: Pass


#### Agenda

Mark: Good

Feedback: The agenda was added to the repository in time and it had a good structure that follows the template.  
Try to add some more bullet points of discussion for the main topics of the meeting. Too much detail is not needed, but just so that teammates have a greater insight into what is going to be discussed.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The notes contain the team agreements, important decisions, future deadlines and suggestions from me.  
Everything was written down while talking, together with any modifications.  
The notes document is comprehensive and has a good structure, following the topics discussed based on the agenda.
Notes sent right after the meeting. 

*Please don't forget to also upload the notes to the repository. (You can upload past agendas and notes too)*


#### Chair performance

Mark: Good

Feedback: All topics of the agenda were covered.  
Chair took into account suggestions from the team that were addressed before the meeting and incorporated them in the schedule.   
The meeting went a bit faster than the chair expected, so he came up with some additional topics to fill up the time. Try to manage your time better, so you don't end up with either time left and no more topics to talk about or too many topics left an not so much time.  
Good summary at the end, clear and concise.


#### Relation

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: The meeting went well with people always sharing ideas, making agreements and checking on each other. Different comments/opinions were taken into account.  
However, a few of you were kind of silent for most of the meeting, so please pay attention to this if you feel like you are in this situation and try to improve for the next meetings!

##### To answer the question about the Checkstyle, you have to create your own, so you cannot add on top of an existing one. So just configure the checkstyle file that is in your repository (right now it is empty -> add your checkstyle rules).
