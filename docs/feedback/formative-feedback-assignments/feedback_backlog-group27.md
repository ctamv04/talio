### Backlog

### Submission

Mark: Pass

Feedback: The file is correctly submited on GitLab, before the deadline.


### Backlog Structure

Mark: Pass

Feedback: The backlog contains all the necessary parts (list of stakeholders, important terms of the domain and a (prioritized) list of user stories).
The stakeholders and terminology are clearly stated and explained.


### Epics

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: The backlog contains requirements for "minimal app" (what you have as MUST currently)  
The list of requirements is prioritized based on the order stated during the lectures.

However, unfortunately there was a missunderstanding regarding the list of requirements. You must group the requirements by Epics instead of MOSCOW (hence, only sufficient grade for this section). The order in which you put the requirements is mostly correct, you just have to group them differently.  
Please use the slides as a reference on how to group them into Epics (Requirements-Engineering-Slides).

### User Stories

Mark: Good

Feedback: All user stories follow the required format.  
User stories have a clear focus on the user perspective, but I feel like there is some overlap between some of them.  
Try to describe each particular interaction with only one user story and not repeat the ideas throughout different epics (for example you are talking about a pleasant appearance/background in both could and should).


### Acceptance Criteria

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: There are no acceptance criteria for any of the user stories.   
If the user story has a clear effect, then the acceptance criteria are implicit.  
However, if the user story is overloaded, you should define concrete and measurable acceptance criteria for it.  
You do not need to have AC for every user story, only fot he ones that are more complex.  
As a reference you can use the Requirements-Engineering-Slides (slide 18).
